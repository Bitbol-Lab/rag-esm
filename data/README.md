This folder contains two example datasets that one can use to test the code in this repository. The datasets are an arrow dataset like the one used to train the model and a dataset of fasta files that one can use to test the model. The datasets are not large and can be used to test the code in this repository. The datasets are not meant to be used for training or testing the model, but rather to test the code in this repository.
